>We will work with data from Major League Baseball games compiled by Retrosheet, a non-profit organization that's gathered game statistics going back to the 1800s to today. The main file we will work from is game_log.csv, which has been compiled and pre-cleaned from 127 separate CSV files from Retrosheet. This file has hundreds of data points on each game. The goal of this  to convert and normalize this data into several separate tables using SQL and create a robust database of game-level statistics.
>
Dataquest


## Reading the data

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
game_log <- read_csv("baseball_data/game_log.csv", na = "")
park_codes <-read_csv("baseball_data/park_codes.csv", na = "")
person_codes <- read_csv("baseball_data/person_codes.csv")
team_codes <- read_csv("baseball_data/team_codes.csv", na = "")
```


```{r}
head(game_log)
```

* `game_log` is the main file of our database. It contains information about 171907 baseball matche encoded in 161 variables : date, place, game statistics, players information.

* `park_codes` adds info pertaining the baseball grounds.

* `person_code` contains info about the players. It joins with the  `game_log` filt through the `id` variable.

* `team_codes` contains information about the baseball teams.

All the fields in `game_log` are explained in the `game_log_fields.txt` file.

In the game log, each player has a defensive position listed in these columns: 

* 106-132 Visiting starting players ID, name and defensive position,listed in the order (1-9) they appeared in the batting order.
* 133-159 Home starting players ID, name and defensive position listed in the order (1-9) they appeared in the batting order. 

This [article] (http://probaseballinsider.com/baseball-instruction/baseball-basics/baseball-basics-positions/) gives us a list of names for each numbered position:

* Pitcher
* Catcher
* 1st Base
* 2nd Base
* 3rd Base
* Shortstop
* Left Field
* Center Field
* Right Field


This information is repeated in columns 72-77 for the home teams.

Wikipedia tells us there are currently two leagues - the American (AL) and National (NL).The fields 5 and 8 contain information about the historical leagues which existed at the time:

```{r}
unique(game_log$h_league)
```

> All of the (candidate) major leagues in baseball have standardized two-letter abbreviations such as NA — namely, NA, NL, AA, UA, PL, AL, FL — whose crucial value is in   this encyclopedic context.
>
[fandom](https://baseball.fandom.com/wiki/National_Association_as_a_major_league#:~:text=All%20of%20the%20%28candidate%29%20major%20leagues%20in%20baseball,encyclopedic%20context.%20To%20count%20or%20not%20to%20count)

* **NL** National League
* **AL** American League
* **UA** Union Association
* **AA** American Association
* **PL** Player's League
* **FL** Federal League

## Tables

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
 
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "mlb.db")


dbWriteTable(conn = con, name = "game_log", value = game_log,
             row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbWriteTable(conn = con, name = "park_codes", value = park_codes,
             row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbWriteTable(conn = con, name = "person_codes", value = person_codes,
             row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbWriteTable(conn = con, name = "team_codes", value = team_codes,
             row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)
```

Since we do not have it yet, we will create a compound primary key for the game_log table using the `h_name`, `date` and `number` of game field.

```{r}

new_c <- 'ALTER TABLE game_log
ADD COLUMN game_id TEXT;'

dbExecute(con, new_c)

data<- 'UPDATE game_log SET game_id = h_name || date || number_of_game
WHERE game_id IS NULL'

dbExecute(con, data)

dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(game_id)) FROM game_log")

```

## Normalization

> Within a table, all of the columns should be related, or be an attribute, to the primary key. Any column that is not an attribute of the primary key is better placed in her own table. The primary key of our game log is `game_id`, and the players' names are not attributes of a game, but of the player ID. If the only data we had was the `game_log`, we would remove this column and create a new table that had the names of each player. As it happens, our `person_codes` table already has a list of our player IDs and names, so we can remove these without the need for creating a new table first.
>
> We want to also eliminate any redundant data that is available elsewhere. This second example can be found in the `park_codes` table.The start and end columns indicate the dates for the first and last games played at the park. This information can also be derived by looking at the park information for each game, so we might want to remove these columns from this table. The same observation can be applied to the  `team_codes` table.
>
Dataquest

* Some info contained in the `person_codes` and `team_codes` table can be probably deduced from `game_log`: the player's and career start and the eventual roles that he covered afterwards, the teams debut and final matches .

## Database Creation

```{r}
# person table

person <- "CREATE TABLE person (
           person_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
           first_name TEXT,
           last_name TEXT);"

insert_person <- "INSERT INTO person
                  SELECT id, first, last
                  FROM person_codes"

dbExecute(con, person)
dbExecute(con, insert_person)
dbGetQuery(con,"SELECT * FROM person
           LIMIT 10")
```

```{r}
#park table

dbExecute(con,'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS park')

park <- 'CREATE TABLE park(
         park_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
         name TEXT,
         nickname TEXT,
         city TEXT,
         state TEXT,
         notes TEXT
);'

insert_park <- 'INSERT INTO park
                SELECT park_id, name, aka, city, state, notes
                FROM park_codes;'

dbExecute(con, park)
dbExecute(con, insert_park)
dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT * FROM park LIMIT 10')
```

```{r}
#league table

league <- 'CREATE TABLE league (
           league_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
           name TEXT);'

insert_league <- 'INSERT INTO league
                  SELECT DISTINCT(league) as league_id, 
                         CASE league
                         WHEN "NL" THEN "National League"
                         WHEN "AL" THEN "American League"

                         FROM team_codes'

dbExecute(con, league)
dbExecute(con, insert_league)
dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT * FROM league')

```

```{r}

#appearance type

dbWriteTable(con, name = "appearance_type", value = "baseball_data/appearance_type.csv",
             row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE )

dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT * FROM appearance_type')
```

## `Game` and `team` tables

Here are some notes on the normalization choices made with each of these tables:

### Team

The start, end, and sequence columns can be derived from the game level data.

### Game

>We have chosen to include all columns for the game log that don't refer to one specific team or player, instead putting those in two appearance tables.
We have removed the column with the day of the week, as this can be derived from the date.
We have changed the day_night column to day, with the intention of making this a boolean column. Even though SQLite doesn't support the BOOLEAN type, we can use this when creating our table and SQLite will manage the underlying types behind the scenes (for more on how this works refer to the SQLite documentation. This means that anyone quering the schema of our database in the future understands how that column is intended to be used.
