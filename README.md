# Baseball database

## Tools

* SQLite
* RStudio

We will work with data from Major League Baseball games compiled by Retrosheet, a non-profit organization that's gathered game statistics going back to the 1800s to today. The main file we will work from is game_log.csv, which has been compiled and pre-cleaned from 127 separate CSV files from Retrosheet. This file has hundreds of data points on each game. The goal of is to convert and normalize this data into several separate tables using SQL and create a robust database of game-level statistics.

* Import data into SQLite through RStudio
* Design a normalized database schema
* Create tables for our schema
* Insert data into our schema
